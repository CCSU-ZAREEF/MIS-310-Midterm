# MIS-310-Midterm

This midterm project includes three small Python GUI apps using Tkinter (plus Pillow and pandas) that simulate simple CCSU-themed tools.

Midterm_Project_1.py: A basic window where the user enters how many books they purchased this month. The program validates the input and uses if/elif logic to assign and display reward points based on the number of books.

Midterm_Project_2.1.py: A CCSU Mobile App interface that shows a CCSU logo (with transparent background) and reads data from `midterm_exam.csv`. Buttons for Calendar, Buildings, and Faculty each display the corresponding column from the CSV in a label area.

Midterm_Project_2.2.py: An improved version of the CCSU Mobile App with a larger window, a centered logo, and a bordered white results panel. It keeps the Calendar/Buildings/Faculty buttons and adds School of Business and MIS Department buttons, which show predefined lists of programs and courses in the same display area.
